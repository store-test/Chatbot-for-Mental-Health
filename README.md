## **Mental Health Support Chatbot**

Developing a mental health support chatbot built as a **Hybrid Dialogue System**. This is a hybrid dialogue system that combines rule-based response models with modern large language models (LLMs) to provide automated responses tailored to each userâ€™s situation and needs.

## **Dataset**

The chatbot's dataset is compiled from a variety of reliable sources, including books, documents, and research papers related to mental health. Aggregating data from credible sources ensures that the responses and advice provided by the chatbot are based on well-founded knowledge and principles, offering valuable support to users.

## **LangChain**

LangChain is the primary framework used in this project for building dialogue flows and managing large language models (LLMs). LangChain enables the integration of diverse language models and allows for seamless optimization and conversation handling. With LangChain, the system can deploy complex conversation flows and manage context efficiently, providing a natural interactive experience for users.

## **Language Models Used**

To evaluate and compare the chatbot's effectiveness, the project employs several large language models, including GPT-3.5, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and VinaLLama. This comparison helps identify the optimal model for mental health responses while assessing each model's capabilities and limitations when applied to specific conversational scenarios.
